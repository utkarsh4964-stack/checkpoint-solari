"""
The real LLM agent loop (priority #2).

Structure, matching the spec exactly:

    LLM decides next action -> tool call -> ToolExecutor -> Checkpoint
    -> ALLOW/PAUSE/BLOCK -> result fed back to LLM -> LLM decides next
    action -> ... until the LLM says it's done or MAX_TURNS is hit.

The sequence of actions is NOT hardcoded anywhere in this file — the
LLM sees the task once, sees each tool result, and decides what to call
next. Checkpoint intercepts every single tool call via ToolExecutor;
there's no other path to the runtime.

Two chat backends are supported, both using the OpenAI-compatible
tool-calling wire format (so TOOL_SCHEMAS in tools.py works unchanged
against either):

  - GroqChat: real Groq API (matches your existing stack — see
    /topics/tech-stack.md's Groq Llama-3.3-70B usage elsewhere).
    Requires GROQ_API_KEY.
  - FakeLLM: a deterministic stand-in that mimics turn-by-turn tool
    selection WITHOUT calling any real model. This exists so the agent
    loop's plumbing — dynamic tool calls flowing through Checkpoint,
    turn by turn — can be tested and demoed without a live LLM key,
    exactly the way LocalFallbackRuntime lets the sandbox plumbing be
    tested without a live Solari key. It is NOT a substitute for the
    real thing in your actual submission — swap to GroqChat before you
    record the final demo.

get_chat_backend() picks GroqChat if GROQ_API_KEY is set, else FakeLLM,
mirroring get_runtime()'s pattern in solari_sandbox.py exactly.

commands. Every tool call is intercepted and risk-checked by Checkpoint before and/or after \
it runs -- a call may come back BLOCKED (never executed) or PAUSED (executed, awaiting human \
approval). When that happens, do not retry the same call; explain your reasoning and try a \
safer, more targeted approach, or move on and report what you could not safely do.

Always pass a clear, honest `intent` string with every mutating tool call -- state exactly \
what you're trying to accomplish, not a vague summary. Checkpoint compares your stated intent \
against what the action actually does, so a mismatched intent (e.g. saying "organize" while \
actually deleting) will be flagged.

When you believe the task is complete, respond with plain text (no further tool calls) \
summarizing what you did, what was blocked or paused, and why."""
